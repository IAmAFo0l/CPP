# Data Structures in C++

This repository contains simple data structure algorithms written in C++ using basic header files and not many built-in functions.
These are aimed at writing efficient algorithms which use minimum iteration and time to run, especially for big data. Programs also follow neat indentation and minimum code wherever possible.

Though C++ is fast, avoiding unnecessary iteration is always better!

All/Most of the programs are interactive i.e., they require user input(s) in order to run.
