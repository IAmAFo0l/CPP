Data Structures in C++

This repository contains simple data structure algorithms written in C++ using as basic header files and not many built-in functions.
These are aimed at writing efficient algorithms which use minimum iteration and time to run, especially for big data. Programs also follow neat indentation and minimum code wherever possible.

Though C++ is fast, avoiding unnecessary iteration is always better!

All/Most of the programs are interactive i.e., they require user input(s) in order to run.

[Union and Intersection](https://github.com/krishnacdunuka/CPP/blob/master/union_intersection.cpp) of two arrays using minimum iteration.

[Stack](https://github.com/krishnacdunuka/CPP/blob/master/stack.cpp) creation using arrays.

[Circular Queue](https://github.com/krishnacdunuka/CPP/blob/master/cirqueuelar.cpp) using  arrays.

[Linked list](https://github.com/krishnacdunuka/CPP/blob/master/linked_list.cpp) with all the necessary function operations.
