Data Structures in C++

This repository contains simple data structure algorithms written in C++ using as basic header files and not many built-in functions.
These algorithms are aimed at writing efficient algorithms which use minimum iteration and time to run, especially for big data.

Though C++ is very fast, avoiding unnecessary iteration is always better!

All/Most of the programs are user interactive i.e., they require user input in order to run.
